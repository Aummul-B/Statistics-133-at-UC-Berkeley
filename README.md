Stat 133: Concepts in Computing with Data is a course to computational data analysis using the statistical programming language R (and other computational tools) with an emphasis on five major cornerstones:

Data Manipulation (wrangling, reshaping, tidying)
Data Visualization (focus on statistical charts)
Programming Concepts (with emphasis on data analysis)
Data Technologies (various sources/formats of data)
Reporting Tools (via dynamic documents)

Stat 133 is one of the core courses of the Statistics Department of UC Berkeley underlying goal of teaching students how to:

-understand common data formats
-use the computer extensively to conduct statistical analysis of data.
-use existing software rather than build routines from the ground up.
-understand how to visualize data and display statistical information
-learn the basic principles for writing code
-organize your workflow
-focus on aspects of computing to conduct data analysis, NOT the computational aspects of statistical methods
-use computational tools to carry out the data analysis cycle
